## About Me
I am a PhD candidate and I have completed master's in computer science and software engineering. I am currently pursuing master's in data science engineering at Auburn University and I graduate in May 2022. I am looking to find a job as Machine Learning Engineer or Data Scientist to gain work experience in professional environment.

I have been studying and researching in the field of Machine Learning since 2018. I am highly skilled at implementing Deep Learning applications using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. I am currently learning google cloud platform for deploying ML applications for buisness models. I have a good understanding of mathematics of Machine Learning algorithms and capable of figuring out what algorithms and data processing techniques are required based on application.

My research interests are in studying spiking neural networks and computational neuroscience. I believe that understanding the fundamentals of how brain neurons respond to sensory informations from sensory organs, we may be able to find solutions to existing bottlenecks of machine learning, such as high power consumption for computations while training a model, better feature extractions, explainability for predictions, etc. 

## Work Experience

### Graduate Assistantship, 
*September, 2017 - Present* | Auburn University, AL

- **Exploiting vulnerability in Reinforcement Learning**
  - Used gradient based attacks on Reinforcement Learning (RL) models trained using state of the art methods (PPO, SAC) to detect vulnerability in decision making   of the agent for applications such as self driving cars.
  - Implemented these algorithms using **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.
